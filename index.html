    		Hi! My name is Jake and I am a third-year computer science student at UCLA. Ever since I built my first gaming computer when I was 15, I have loved all things software and tech. Taking courses like Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, and Computer Graphics in addition to my previous internship experience troubleshooting and documenting Python and Django applications has allowed me to pursue and cultivate this passion. I have extensive experience developing software with Python, C++, JavaScript, Swift, HTML, and Bash. I am currently seeking a 2021 summer internship opportunity in software engineering to apply my skills.

    		When I am not coding, I enjoy hiking, piano, video games, film photography, concerts, and
